      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of our favorite anoles made it to the cover of &lt;em&gt;Ecological Applications&lt;/em&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are super happy to share that our paper titled &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.doi.org/10.1002/eap.2960&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Recolonization of secondary forests by a locally extinct Caribbean anole through the lens of range expansion theory&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; made it to the cover of the journal Ecological Applications. Recovering forests are becoming a prevalent characteristic of the Anthropocene landscape, particularly in the tropics. Some of these recovering forests provide the minimum requirements for the recolonization of fauna. In this study we study this process of fauna recolonization through the lens of range expansion. We compared phenotypic traits, population dynamics, and parasitism rates of a shade-specialist anole (&lt;em&gt;Anolis gundlachi&lt;/em&gt;) among forests of different ages in Puerto Rico. Our results show that animals in young forests have unique phenotypic traits, lower densities, and suffer less parasitism rates, as predicted by range expansion theory. This was a highly collaborative study including many graduate and undergraduate researchers in our group. We are excited to show off this beautiful anole in the cover the journal. Look at that beautiful blue eyes!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Congratulations to Carly for the successful defense of her MS thesis!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are super happy to announce that Carly successfully defended her thesis titled &lt;em&gt;ECO-EVOLUTIONARY DYNAMICS OF A THERMOCONFORMING ANOLE RECOLONIZING SECONDARY FOREST&lt;/em&gt;. For her thesis she compared genomic diversity and structure of &lt;em&gt;Anolis gundlachi&lt;/em&gt; among forests of different ages in Puerto Rico. She also collaborated in multiple other projects in our lab and co-authored three peer-reviewed publications.  We wish her the very best in her future endeavors.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Matt, Brynn and Megan presented in the undergraduate research symposium</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Our undergraduate research team presented their research&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many studies on habitat-species relationships evaluate the role of habitat variables using buffers of certain sizes. Still, what is the optimal size? Megan, Matt, Brynn and Orlando have been working to estimate what is the optimal scale to quantify species-habitat relationships in a group of tropical birds from the genus &lt;em&gt;Thraupis&lt;/em&gt; using eBird data. Their preliminary results suggest that&amp;hellip;one size may not fit all. Good job team!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Nick just graduated from his PhD! Congratulations Dr. Gengler!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nick initial PhD idea was to work on quantitative approaches to better understand and manage mammal communities in Paraguay. And then COVID19 happened. He couldn&amp;rsquo;t travel to Paraguay so instead, Nick developed a pretty clever plan b, to address one of the most important challenges in landscape ecology. As part of his dissertation Nick conducted a global analysis compare the scale of effect of landscape composition and configuration of forest mammals. Nick&amp;rsquo;s degree was supported by an (NSF-GRF)[https://www.nsfgrfp.org/]. We are grateful of NSF for supporting his career. Paraguay didn&amp;rsquo;t happened for his PhD, but&amp;hellip;he landed a position with local NGO in Paraguay working in mammal conservation. Nick&amp;rsquo;s story is one of perseverance and success.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Data Papers 2.0 (ESA 2023)</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We are back from Portland, where we did a workshop on Data Papers and the future of open science at ESA 2023.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The future of ecology is intrinsically tied to our ability to conduct open science. Data Papers are a special type of paper in Ecology where data and metadata are published to be reused. Our group of ESA Data Paper Editors composed of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.usgs.gov/index.php/staff-profiles/grace-v-direnzo&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Grace DiRenzo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://haoye.us/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Hao Ye&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.picardiecology.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Simona Picardi&lt;/a&gt;, and myself are working towards a re conceptualization of this important type of paper. We are following a data-driven process that includes gathering input from the community. As part of this process we led a special session at ESA where our community engaged in a super fun and highly engaging brainstorming session. Working with this group is a real luxury! Stay tuned as we we will announce soon the new features of Data Papers 2.0!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>We are back from Puerto Rico (Summer 2023)</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We are back from the field collecting data on lizard malaria in Puerto Rico.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was an awesome and productive field season! Our first mission was to collect data for our long-term study of lizard-malaria dynamics. (Yes, lizards get malaria. No, you will not likely get malaria from a lizard). One of the biggest mysteries in this system is the vector identity. We know that malaria gets transmitted among lizards by an insect vector, but we don&amp;rsquo;t know who it is. This field season, we brought the big guns! We joined forces with &lt;a href=&#34;https://yeemosquitolab.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Don Yee&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lawrencereeves.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Lawrence Reeves&lt;/a&gt;&amp;hellip;and&amp;hellip;during a night walk we finally saw our suspected vector biting lizards! We are working as a team to report our findings in a peer-reviewed publication. Needless to say that we are super excited about the discovery!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We are back from the Colombian Amazon in an expedition to assess Orlando&amp;rsquo;s study sites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Amazon&amp;hellip;did we need to say more?! What a fantastic expedition. We spent nine days in Vaup√©s, Colombia-one of the most isolated parts of the Colombian Amazon where Orlando wants to do one of the chapters of his dissertation. We were joined by &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.floridamuseum.ufl.edu/museum-voices/scott-robinson/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Scott Robinson&lt;/a&gt; so&amp;hellip;yes&amp;hellip;we were interested in those hyper diverse bird communities, particularly those that lived white sand forests. Orlando&amp;rsquo;s questions about climate change and bird-species assemblages in the Amazon are timely, the study site magical, and the local indigenous communities welcoming. We can&amp;rsquo;t wait to be back!&lt;/p&gt;</description>
